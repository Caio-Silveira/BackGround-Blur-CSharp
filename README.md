# Usage Instructions - Blur Effect

This repository contains a C# code example that implements a blur effect for Windows Forms windows. The blur effect can be applied to a specific window, providing an elegant and modern appearance.

## How to Use the Code

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or another C# development environment.

3. The code is divided into three sections defining the namespaces `Example`, `Blur`, and `W_APIs`.

   - The `W_APIs` namespace contains the necessary Windows API imports to apply the blur effect.
   - The `Blur` namespace contains a static method `SetBlur` that applies the blur effect to a specific window, taking the window handle (`handle`) as a parameter.
   - The `Main` namespace contains the `Main` class representing the main form of the application. In the `Main_Load` method, the blur effect is applied to the current window.

4. The `SetBlur` method is defined in the `Blur` class, which is static and does not need to be instantiated.

5. The `SetBlur` method is called in the `Main_Load` event of the `Main` form to apply the blur effect to the current window (`this.Handle`).

6. To test the blur effect, run the application. The main window should have a visual blur effect applied.

## Important Notes

- Make sure the project is properly configured with the Windows Forms platform and all necessary references.

- This example uses Windows API imports (in the `W_APIs` namespace) to apply the blur effect. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of compatibility and restrictions for different versions of Windows.

- If issues occur when applying the blur effect, verify that the Windows APIs are compatible with the version of the operating system on which the application is running.
